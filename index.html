<h3>Welcome To Daystar…The Home of Stars<h3></h3>

<p>At Daystar Christian Centre, the most recurrent word is change.Timely and inspired change is the mark of a healthy church that is alive to the directive of the Holy Spirit.
Daystar has evolved over the years, passing through series of changes required for more effective church ministry and by implication a greater impact on the larger society.

In this vein, the church has been restructured to function in line with its core purposes which are: membership, maturity, evangelism and mission, ministry and worship.

You have probably heard the phrase “You are what you eat” before and it is usually a statement that is made in reference to food. However, it can also be applied to the things we “feed” our spirits on a daily basis. The foods we eat are responsible for sustaining our physical bodies and allowing us to maintain good health. Likewise, the prosperity of our souls depends on our spiritual food choices.

                I remember clearly, the day I got to church in the morning and met the workers outside, 
                they told me they were not allowed into the hall. I went in and spoke to the manager who was playing games
                with his friends in the hall we were supposed to use for our service.
                 I told him to let us run the service and pay him after the service with the offerings but he refused.
